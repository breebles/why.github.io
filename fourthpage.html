    <p>
      Of all the stupid decisions you've made in your life, this has GOT to be the most lethal one. You turn around and try to face the demonic train that's been tailing you, to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas crawls at you on all fours, dragging his caboose along with him. Before he reaches you, an estimated 30-foot blast of steam blasts your body where you stand. You receive 3rd degree burns before the cursed tank engine gets to you, but you haven't died just yet. You're given a front row seat to your demise. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You fall backwards from the blast, your flesh warped and melting from the extreme heat of his first attack. He crawls over you, blocking out the little sunlight present through the intense snow storm around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shit. Shit. Shit." Your thoughts are racing. Your heart feels like it's in your throat. You made a HUGE mistake. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas, still wearing his smiling and friendly facade, begins to let out a...whistle? No. A high pitched scream is coming from behind it's face. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's mask slowly lifts up to reveal a black void. You don't know the depth of this void, or the contents of it. All you can hear are screams. Women, men, children. Some pleading for help. Blood-curdling screams echoed throughout the train's body, making this childhood icon into an eldritch horror. You wish you could let out a sound to cope with this terror, but the pain of the steam blast has rendered you helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Thomas lifts you up and begins to swallow you into his maw, you can't help but think about how terribly your train commute turned out. The last thing that runs through your mind before you're swallowed whole? "I just wanted to take the LIRR."
