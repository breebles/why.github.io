    What the F U C K is that.

    You start hauling ass down the icy platform, trying to make sure not to slip into the tracks with that thing. You grew up with Thomas the Tank Engine, but there's no way in hell you're going to get caught by that Chernobyl demon spawn.

    As you continue  along the tracks, being mindful to not slip onto the third rail, you notice the end of the track leads to a fork in the road. The closer you get, the more apparent it becomes. To the left, you see an open field (a backyard, perhaps?) To the right, a man yelling to you from his front porch.
