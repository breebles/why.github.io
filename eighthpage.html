      You enter the field which is, in fact, a backyard. However, it's not inhabited. The home has been set on fire, and you are staring down something even worse than the quadraped Thomas behind. Far FAR worse. You look up in terror as the last thing you feel is a mix of gasoline and fire hitting your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you roll around on the dry grass, your eyes melting into your sockets, you grasp the one thing you saw amid your frantic attempt at recovery. It was...Thomas? But, how? It was taller, looking more like a spider than the odd, snail hybrid you saw before. Your last thought is of how you just wanted to take a peaceful train ride. Just a few seconds after, your mind goes blank, and your body slumps as the fire continues to burn around you. Without knowing it, you have unwillingly cremated yourself.
