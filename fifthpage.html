      The thought of getting caught by that demonic shit behind you is too terrifying to cope with. You make a hard right towards the house, run through the doors, and drop to the floor from exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As quickly as you get in, the man slams the door behind the both of you, and begins nailing board of wood over it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looks moritified but determined to keep the both of you safe. Though you want to thank him for letting you hide in his home, you can't help but feel extremely anxious. Not from the man, who is clearly just as shaken up about this whole ordeal as you. No, your nervous about the power of that thing. The idea of it possible busting through the door, the wall, a window. As the man walks over to you to check up on your mental state, all you can muster is a weak smile before you faint.
