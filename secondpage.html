  As you continue to pay no mind to the sound, an even odder occurence begins to happen: The ground is shaking. Violently. Violently enough to knock you straight in to the tracks laid in front of you. Scattered, you look down the way of the tracks to make sure you have time to get out of the way of any (possible) incoming trains. 
  </p>
<p>
  You have no choice but to turn around towards the now deafening sound of music, which is coincidentally coming down the tracks toward you.
