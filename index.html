      You're standing on the train platform, headphones in your ears. It's a
      pretty chilly day, frost covering the ground and a weather forecast for
      heavy snow. As you wait, the snow begins to come down in buckets in a
      matter of (what felt like) seconds since you've started standing here. The
      heavier the snowfall, the louder a distant, familiar song plays. You want
      to ignore the odd sound, but you're getting pretty curious...
