    <p>
      Waking up a bit groggy, you look up to see a man with a rifle standing
      over you. You jump, wince from the pain you endured after you fall (seems
      you fractured your wrist), and scoot away from him in a panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused, he looks around with his gun at the ready. He finally realizes
      that his sudden appearance may have shocked you. "Oh, shit, sorry! Sorry.
      You fell out, so I got worried. Ran over to check up on you after I
      boarded up the windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      As you look around what seems to be the living room, you can see he wasn't
      lying. The man, in the short amount of time you had been out cold from the
      initial shock, had boarded up every window and doorway. If you hadn't been
      nearly killed, you would have laughed and commented on how quickly he'd
      accomplished it. But, right now, you're just full of nervous questions and
      stutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I-Where did it-How did you-Oh my god what the fUC-" He runs over and
      covers your mouth. "I know you're scared, but you have to be quiet. I saw
      you running, and heard that god awful music, again. The last time I heard
      it was the last time I saw my sister. She had went out there to see why
      someone was playing the Thomas the Tank Enging theme song outside our
      house, but-"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. You can hear how choked up he sounds, a lump in his
      throat. You mourn the loss of his sister, holding a vigil as night fell upon his home.
      He explains later that her death only happened a few minutes before he saw
      you runnning, and he couldn't let another innocent person get killed in
      such a horrific and unexplainable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you bandage yourself up with the spare first aid kit that your savior handed you, you vow that whatever the hell is going on, you'll pay your gratitude forward. You'll be sure to help as many people as you can from Thomas' murderous rampage.   </p>
